The visual Internet of Things framework powered by Node.js, Express, D3 and jsPlumb.

##What
Project Zygote is an end to end IoT framework which enables developers, makers and hobbyists to rapidly prototype and deploy their IoT application. Makers and hackers should be able to seamlessly interconnect hardware resources (sensors, actuators) between themselves or to software components (graphs, gauges, etc.). The framework is platform neutral, meaning you can run it on the Beaglebone Black, the Raspberry Pi or any damn thing that runs Node.js (maybe even tessel!). Everything is accessible and configurable through the browser, no complex installations. 

##Why
Interconnecting things is **hard**. It takes knowledge of underlying hardware, working of sensors, installing tools, knowing programming, connecting the 'thing' to the internet etc. It makes it even worse when people want to visualize the data or give visual input. Project Zygote simplifies all these tasks by providing a DRY (Do not repeat yourself) framework. 

##How

Coming soon ;)
